For now, just a brainstorming place and place to gather thoughts or make 
pseudocode. Also probably will place cited stuff here too

Ok, so we've got the Line class being worked on. So far we've established its
base instance variables, its starting/ending points, and checks for it to see 
if it knows if its horizontal or vertical. It can also realize that if it isn't
either one of those, it will be denoted as diagonal.

We now have a player figure drawn and mapped onto the canvas. Need to work on 
collision and physics tomorrow.
