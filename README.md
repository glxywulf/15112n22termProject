This is my Python recreation of the video game Jump King, implemented with most,
if not all, of the features from the game. It is aptly named Jump 112 as it is
my submission for the CMU 15-112 Term Project for the N22 semester.

As stated, this is a recreation of the game, Jump King, which utilizes Python
and the CMU 112 graphics package. The aim of the game is to try and reach the 
top of the game by jumping through an ellaborate obstacle course with the danger
of losing all of one's progress if they misstep.

Download all of the files and run the Main.py file. Main controls for movement 
are the right and left arrow keys. Jumping is triggered by the space key. 

Note that the jumping feature may not work entirely as programmed if you are running
MacOS the keyPressed and keyReleased events will occur incorrectly.

You will encounter wind throughout levels 26-32 and ice on levels 37-39. 
You'll also be unable to move while on the ground during levels 27-31, where
you have to utilize the wind and jumps to make it higher.

A couple debugging tools include the use of the 'r' and 'n' keys on the keyboard.
'r' will reset the app to it's initial state and 'n' will skip the current level 
and move on to the next level.
